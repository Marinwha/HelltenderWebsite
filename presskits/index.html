						<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
						<p>
							HELLTENDER is a narrative-driven 3D bartending game where players mix drinks, extract secrets, and navigate the
							emotional wreckage of the damned. You play as Dana, a burned-out twenty-something who's just died and crash-landed in
							the First Circle of Hell. Your afterlife job? Serve cocktails and weaponise gossip to help your boss blackmail her way
							up the demonic hierarchy. And Dana? Her head's a mess, and you're the one stuck trying to pull her mental state back
							in one piece shift by shift. Beyond the bar, you can step out into the crumbling city of Pandemondium, exploring its
							alleys, markets, and ruins as you piece together Dana's mind.
						</p>
						<em>Mix drinks, blackmail demons, and figure out the meaning of life.</em>

						
						<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
						Set in the city of Pandemondium. Located on the first cirlce of Hell, it is a ruinous metropolis built from human regret.
						A eternal winter blankets all unlucky enough to be caught outside. Trash and forgotten objects from earth rain down from
						the sky. Human souls run the torture economy for the lower circles. Demons surge upward, wreaking chaos whenever they
						please. Annual purges annihilate millions, leaving them in fates worse than death. But beneath the fire and bureaucracy,
						the story is about broken people struggling to find meaning; even here.
						<h2 id="history">History</h2>
						<p>
							Originally started as small arcade game. Few years of scope creep; playing Persona 5, VA-11 HALL-A and my weird
							obbession with worldbuilding, and demons; ballooned it into a huge scope narrative game. Someone decided to donate 10
							quid on the unfinished website, and gave me motivation to actually see it through.

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
						<h3 id="features">Immersive Cocktail Crafting</h3>
						<p>
							Forget simple point-and-click gameplay. In Helltender, you'll mix drinks from the ground up; pouring, shaking, and
							serving in full 3D. Master the art of cocktail creation, as every drink may be the key to gathering blackmail or
							sparking unexpected outcomes.
						</p>
						<h3 id="features">Story-driven Choices</h3>
						<p>
							Your actions have real weight. By spiking drinks, you can push patrons to reveal secrets they'd never share sober,
							pushing your boss' adgenda but steer their storylines in unexpected directions. Use that information wisely. or watch
							it come back to haunt you.
						</p>
						<h3 id="features">Life and Work Balance</h3>
						<p>
							Explore a living, breathing city in Hell, where you can buy supplies, meet characters, and dive into optional content.
							There's always something to do, whether it's giving your self up to the depravity of Hell or unwinding after a chaotic
							shift.
						</p>
						<h3 id="features">Apartment Customization</h3>
						<p>
							After a long day of serving fiery drinks to unpredictable patrons, retreat to your apartment. Unwind and customize
							your space, making it a home amidst the pandemonium.
						</p>
						<h3 id="features">Unique Worldbuilding</h3>
						<p>
							Experience a fresh fusion of cyberpunkish dystopia, kafka absurdism and a hellscape of biblical proportions, where the
							stakes are high and the boundaries of good and evil are blurred. Immerse yourself in a world unlike any other, where
							every corner of Hell holds something new to discover.

						<p>
							Hi! We are a just two friends trying to make something cool. Ruckinator is the main writer. RiskofRuins, the one writing this, wears all the hats: code, writing, art, ALL the hats. And she ultimately got the ball rolling. Why am I called "Risk of Ruin". Well I believe that game venture always has a risk fo failure. I embrace this risk and jump head first into it. My interest in extensial themes has shaped this project into condensed version of my mind. And I think my mind is pretty interesting. Hopefully this project doesn't live up to my name. Ultimately, regardless of the outcome, at least I hope one person finds this game interesting enough to make a hour long video essay. Loving or hating the game. Who cares! How awesome it would be to have someone obess over your work.
						</p>
						<p>
							My ultimate dream is to keep expanding this (currently not legally recognised) company into something HUGE. I want to walk into a OFFICE BUILDING, and walk past rows of office cubicles, with all my employees running around in a panic because the release date for for HELLTENDER V is in a week, and the build crashes in the tutorial for some reason. Well grand dreams aside, I just want to keep making cool games. Whether that means Ruinworks becomes a huge ATLUS level company with a bunch of narrative games under its belt, or remains just two friends hacking away. However it manifests, as long as I can keep making cool unique experiences, and just even one person cares? Thats the most I can ask for.
